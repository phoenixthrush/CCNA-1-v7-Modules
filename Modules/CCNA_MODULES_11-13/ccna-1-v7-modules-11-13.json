    "question": "Refer to the exhibit. Considering the addresses already used and having to remain within the 10.16.10.0/24 network range, which subnet address could be assigned to the network containing 25 hosts? 10.16.10.160/26 10.16.10.128/28 10.16.10.64/27 10.16.10.224/26 10.16.10.240/27 10.16.10.240/28 Explanation: Addresses 10.16.10.0 through 10.16.10.63 are taken for the leftmost network. Addresses 10.16.10.192 through 10.16.10.207 are used by the center network.The address space from 208-255 assumes a /28 mask, which does not allow enough host bits to accommodate 25 host addresses.The address ranges that are available include 10.16.10.64/26 and10.16.10.128/26. To accommodate 25 hosts, 5 host bits are needed, so a /27 mask is necessary. Four possible /27 subnets could be created from the available addresses between 10.16.10.64 and 10.16.10.191: 10.16.10.64/27 10.16.10.96/27 10.16.10.128/27 10.16.10.160/27 How to calculate the range of available addresses with /27 subnets ?? Reply Vinarino 3 years ago Reply to Tony Group-Size = number hosts needed (-2) /27 [.224] [00011111] typically has a group-size of 32 THUS: 32 -2 = 30 128 group size = 128 - 10000000 (126 hosts available) /25 192 group size = 64 - 11000000 ( 62 hosts available) /26 224 group size = 32 - 11100000 ( 30 hosts available) /27 <== 30 (25 needed) 240 group size = 16 - 11110000 ( 14 hosts available) /28 248 group size = 8 - 11111000 ( 6 hosts available) /29 252 group size = 4 - 11111100 ( 2 hosts available) /30 254 group size = 2 - 11111110 ( 1 host available) /31 255 group size = 1 - 11111111 ( 0 hosts available) /32 = LOGIC - no calculating required I need 120 hosts. Don’t think. Look for 128. I need 50 hosts. Don’t think. Look for 64 Picture above: .0 and .192 are taken Picture above: /26 & /28 are taken = The in-between is missing Finally 128 is 1000000 (meaning 1 & 0 = two networks available.) 128/2=64 Reply Denis 4 years ago is there a final for module 11- 17?

Reply Author IT Administrator 4 years ago Reply to Matt You can copy to MS Word Reply naby 4 years ago Refer to the exhibit. A company is deploying an IPv6 addressing scheme for its network. The company design document indicates that the subnet portion of the IPv6 addresses is used for the new hierarchical network design, with the s ite subsection to represent multiple geographical sites of the company, the s ub-site section to represent multiple campuses at each site, and the s ubnet section to indicate each network segment separated by routers. With such a scheme, what is the maximum number of subnets achieved per sub-site ? 0 4 16 256 one choice Reply johnny 4 years ago Reply to naby 16 Because only one hexadecimal character is used to represent the subnet, that one character can represent 16 different values 0 through F Reply Cassandra 4 years ago Reply to johnny correct.
