Cable uses the same coaxial cable that carries television signals into the home to provide Internet access. Dialup telephone is much slower than either DSL or cable, but is the least expensive option for home users because it can use any telephone line and a simple modem. Satellite requires a clear line of sight and is affected by trees and other obstructions. None of these typical home options use dedicated leased lines such as T1/E1 and T3/E3."

    "explanation": "1. HTTP governs the way that a web server and client interact. 2. TCP manages individual conversations between web servers and clients. 3. IP is responsible for delivery across the best path to the destination. 4. Ethernet takes the packet from IP and formats it for transmission."

      "data link",
      "physical"
    ],
    "explanation": "The OSI data link and physical layers together are equivalent to the TCP/IP network access layer. The OSI transport layer is functionally equivalent to the TCP/IP transport layer, and the OSI network layer is equivalent to the TCP/IP internet layer. The OSI application, presentation, and session layers are functionally equivalent to the application layer within the TCP/IP model."

    "options": [
      "Network protocols define the type of hardware that is used and how it is mounted in racks.",

      "They all function in the network access layer of TCP/IP.",
      "They are only required for exchange of messages between devices on remote networks."
    ],
    "correct_answers": [
      "They define how messages are exchanged between the source and the destination."
    ],
    "explanation": "Network protocols are implemented in hardware, or software, or both. They interact with each other within different layers of a protocol stack. Protocols have nothing to do with the installation of the network equipment. Network protocols are required to exchange information between source and destination devices in both local and remote networks."

    "question": "What is an advantage of network devices using open standard protocols?",
    "options": [
      "Network communications is confined to data transfers between devices from the same vendor.",

      "Internet access can be controlled by a single ISP in each market.",
      "Competition and innovation are limited to specific types of products."
    ],
    "correct_answers": [
      "A client host and a server running different operating systems can successfully exchange data."
    ],
    "explanation": "An advantage of network devices implementing open standard protocols, such as from the TCP/IP suite, is that clients and servers running different operating systems can communicate with each other. Open standard protocols facilitate innovation and competition between vendors and across markets, and can reduce the occurrence of monopolies in networking markets."

      "to enable the switch to receive frames from attached PCs"
    ],
    "correct_answers": [
      "to enable the switch to be managed remotely"
    ],
    "explanation": "A switch, as a Layer 2 device, does not need an IP address to transmit frames to attached devices. However, when a switch is accessed remotely through the network, it must have a Layer 3 address. The IP address must be applied to a virtual interface rather than to a physical interface. Routers, not switches, function as default gateways."

    ],
    "correct_answers": [
      "The administrator must first enter privileged EXEC mode before issuing the command."

    "explanation": "In order to enter global configuration mode, the command configure terminal, or a shortened version such as config t, must be entered from privileged EXEC mode. In this scenario the administrator is in user EXEC mode, as indicated by the > symbol after the hostname. The administrator would need to use the enable command to move into privileged EXEC mode before entering the configure terminal command."
