    "question": "A client application needs to terminate a TCP communication session with a server. Place the termination process steps in the order that they will occur. (Not all options are used.) Explanation: In order to terminate a TCP session, the client sends to the server a segment with the FIN flag set. The server acknowledges the client by sending a segment with the ACK flag set. The server sends a FIN to the client to terminate the server to client session. The client acknowledges the termination by sending a segment with the ACK flag set. 14. Which flag in the TCP header is used in response to a received FIN in order to terminate connectivity between two network devices?",

      "SYN",
      "RST"
    ],
    "correct_answers": [
      "ACK"
    ],
    "explanation": "In a TCP session, when a device has no more data to send, it will send a segment with the FIN flag set. The connected device that receives the segment will respond with an ACK to acknowledge that segment. The device that sent the ACK will then send a FIN message to close the connection it has with the other device. The sending of the FIN should be followed with the receipt of an ACK from the other device."

      "UDP reassembles the received datagrams in the order they were received."

      "If multiple conversations occur that are using the same service, the source port number is used to track the separate conversations."
    ],
    "explanation": "Both UDP and TCP use port numbers to provide a unique identifier for each conversation. Source port numbers are randomly generated and are used to track different conversations. Destination port numbers identify specific services by using either a default port number for the service or a port number that is assigned manually by a system administrator."
