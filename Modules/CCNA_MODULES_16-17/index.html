Some of the most popular remote exploits are as follows: Man-In-the-middle attack (MITM) - The threat actor gets between devices in the system and intercepts all of the data being transmitted. This information could simply be collected or modified for a specific purpose and delivered to its original destination. Eavesdropping attack - When devices are being installed, the threat actor can intercept data such as security keys that are used by constrained devices to establish communications once they are up and running. SQL injection (SQLi) - Threat actors uses a flaw in the Structured Query Language (SQL) application that allows them to have access to modify the data or gain administrative privileges. Routing attack - A threat actor could either place a rogue routing device on the network or modify routing packets to manipulate routers to send all packets to the chosen destination of the threat actor. The threat actor could then drop specific packets, known as selective forwarding, or drop all packets, known as a sinkhole attack."

For example in this situation, the network administrator could do an extended ping and specify a source address of the gigabit Ethernet port on the router. The destination address would be the IP address of host H1. If the ping succeeds connectivity exists from the Ethernet router interface on R2 to device H1. 39. Refer to the exhibit. Baseline documentation for a small company had ping round trip time statistics of 36/97/132 between hosts H1 and H3. Today the network administrator checked connectivity by pinging between hosts H1 and H3 that resulted in a round trip time of 1458/2390/6066. What does this indicate to the network administrator? Connectivity between H1 and H3 is fine. H3 is not connected properly to the network. Something is causing interference between H1 and R1. Performance between the networks is within expected parameters. Something is causing a time delay between the networks. Explanation: Ping round trip time statistics are shown in milliseconds. The larger the number the more delay. A baseline is critical in times of slow performance. By looking at the documentation for the performance when the network is performing fine and comparing it to information when there is a problem, a network administrator can resolve problems faster. 40.
